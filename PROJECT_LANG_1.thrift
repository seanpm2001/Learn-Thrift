// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-Thrift
// About:
// I decided to make Thrift the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Thrift) as Thrift is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Thrift programming language. It only makes sense to Thrift the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
